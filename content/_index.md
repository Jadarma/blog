Hello, and welcome to my blog!
I am [Dan](about).

This all started with me messing around on a lazy weekend, one thing led to another, and now I guess we are here!
I write _(and rant)_ about programming, Linux, technology, and whatever else crosses my mind.

Feel free to look around, if you're not sure where to start, how about these? ðŸ‘‡
