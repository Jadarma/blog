# The Image Guide

## Mise en place

Gather the ingredients.
I tend to eyeball portions to suit the packaged food.
This is what I had, but not all I used.
If you get an extra yogurt and pack of bacon, you could make this recipe twice and use up everything.
If you want zero waste and are an onion lover like me, you can have the leftover white parts of the spring onion as an
onion stick snack as a side, _or_, you could sub the normal onion with them, your choice.
No waste!

Put the bacon over a baking sheet to cook in the oven for 10-15 minutes at 200C.
It should be dark brown, crunchy and brittle.
Keep an eye on it not to burn it though!
After the bacon is done, swap it with the bread, and toast that as well.

In between waiting for the bacon and toast, there is plenty of time to chop up the rest of the ingredients.
I also recommend you chop the cheese as well instead of bothering to grate it.
It will melt just fine.
If you add chilli peppers, also dice them up more, so they mix better.

## Cooking

Break the eggs into a cold pan ‚Äî I prefer a saucepan here.
_Do not use heat_, or the first eggs will start to cook unevenly.
Add the knobs of butter, and season with salt and pepper.
Don't overdo it, there will be a lot of salt from the bacon and spice from the peppers.

Turn on the flame on low heat and keep stirring until the butter completely melts and blends with the eggs.
At this point you can add the onion and garlic, we want those to cook longer.
The image below is taken right after I added them to the mix.

Now we want to cook the eggs, but we want them runny at the end.
Stir constantly, but take the pan on and off the flame every minute, like
[Gordon Ramsay demonstrates](https://youtu.be/UXtrScuC30E?t=200).
When you need to take a break from stirring to add the ingredients, make sure it's when the heat is off.
Always stir when the heat is on, to keep them liquid.

When the sauce just starts to thicken, you may add your cream, but I always just plan on using plain
yogurt for convenience, and the taste is still amazing.

Now keep the on and off technique while adding ingredients in waves: cheese first, then bacon and peppers, save the
spring onion for last.

If you feel the mixture thickens too quickly, reduce the heat even more.
Stop cooking when reaching the right consistency, it should be soft but not liquid, with small and smooth curds.

With a spoon, serve on toast for immediate consumption.
