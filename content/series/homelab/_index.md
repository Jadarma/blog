The more time you spend tinkering with your PC the more you realize that it's capable of so much more than your
day-to-day, and then you realize it's probably not a good idea to put all your computing eggs in one basket, therefore
let's build a home lab!

This series contains posts related to things I learned during my ongoing adventures in self-hosting, sometimes in no
particular order.

Enjoy!
